# Project 2: VocalKords

### Introduction:

VocalKords gives people an outlet to express their opinions in a succinct, to-the-point(hopefully) manner.
Whether it's constructive or destructive, vehement or apathetic, cordial or accusatory, express your opinions here without fear, unless you choose a username that gives you away of course.

#### Technologies Used:

-HTML5

-CSS3
    -Materialize

-JavaScript
    -Node.js
    -Express.js
        -Express Modules:
        -Morgan
        -Body-Parser
        -Serve-Favicon
    -jQuery
    -AJAX

-MongoDB

-Handlebars

### Approach:

The idea was to implement a combination of CSS Frameworks, Render Engines, AJAX on the front end and make use of MongoDB for CRUD operations.

#### The site allows users to:
1) Create Opinion posts with a Body & Title
2) Read Opinion posts, divided into categories
3) Delete Opinion posts
4) Update a previously posted Opinion post

### Installation Instructions:
1) Navigate to: https://lit-shelf-53913.herokuapp.com/

### Unsolved Problems:
-If no opinions on a category page, input form spills into footer
-On mobile, input form overlaps opinion cards
-The Update Modal should have the existing Title and Body pre-filled in

### Planned Features:
1) Enable more categories
2) User login & authentication
3) Allow users to comment on existing opinions, creating a dialog chain
4) Display most recent Opinions first
5) Allow users to upvote & downvote on opinions
